    "    <li><b>Superposition and Hilbert Space</b>: Qubits live in a <i>Hilbert space</i>, meaning they can exist in a superposition of the |0> and |1> states (They are vectors). This allows qubits to \"explore\" many possibilities simultaneously during computation. However, when measured, the qubit collapses to either |0> or |1>, similar to binary values.</li><br>\n",
    "    <li><b>Measurement</b>: While qubits can be in a \"floating\" superposition state during computation, they become \"bound\" to a binary value—either |0> or |1>—when we measure them.</li><br>\n",
    "    <li><b>Exponential Growth through Entanglement</b>: In classical systems, adding a bit increases the total number of possible states exponentially in terms of the \"space size\" (O(2^n)), where n is the number of bits. Each bit can be 0 or 1, so the more bits you have, the more possible configurations the system can store. However, with qubits, each additional qubit increases the <i>dimensionality</i> of the system's state space exponentially. Qubits are vectors in a high-dimensional space, and when we entangle them, they interact in such a way that the system's state becomes exponentially more complex. This means the <b>dimensional space</b> the qubits can explore grows as O(2^n), but this scaling is not about the number of possible binary configurations; it's about the increasing complexity of the system's overall state as a <i>vector</i>.</li>\n",
